# Tools and Examples
Before introducing custom network topologies, you may be interested in some external tools and examples:

# pipework
Jérôme Petazzoni wrote a [pipework](https://github.com/jpetazzo/pipework) shell script called pipework that helps users connect containers in more complex scenarios.

# playground
Brandon Rhodes created a Python (https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/fopnp/tree/m/playground)， library that provides complete management of Docker container network topologies, including routing and NAT firewalls; as well as servers providing HTTP, SMTP, POP, IMAP, Telnet, SSH, and FTP.
